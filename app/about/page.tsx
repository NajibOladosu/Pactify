            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
              Pactify was founded with a singular vision: to create a platform that removes the friction, uncertainty, and risk from freelance contracts and payments. We believe that freelancers and clients deserve a transparent, efficient, and legally-sound way to work together.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our platform is designed to protect both parties, ensuring that freelancers get paid for their work and clients receive the deliverables they expect. By combining robust contract tools with secure escrow payments, we've created an end-to-end solution for successful freelance relationships.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              Pactify was born from the frustrations of our founders, who experienced firsthand the challenges of freelance workâ€”unclear expectations, delayed payments, contract disputes, and the lack of standardized processes.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2023, a team of freelancers, legal experts, and tech enthusiasts came together to solve these problems. After months of research, development, and user testing, Pactify launched with a suite of tools designed specifically for the unique needs of the freelance economy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since then, we've helped thousands of freelancers and clients create clear agreements, secure payments, and build trusting professional relationships.
            </p>
