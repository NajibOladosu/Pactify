# 🔧 Withdrawal System Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ "Unable to get verification status" Error

**Problem**: The KYC check endpoint was looking for database columns (`kyc_status`, `verification_level`, `stripe_connect_account_id`) that didn't exist in the profiles table, and trying to query a `kyc_verifications` table that didn't exist.

**Solution**: 
- ✅ **Fixed Database Schema** - Added all missing KYC columns to profiles table
- ✅ **Created Missing Tables** - Added `kyc_verifications`, `withdrawal_methods`, and `payout_fees` tables
- ✅ **Updated KYC Endpoint** - Made it handle missing data gracefully with proper defaults
- ✅ **Auto-approved Basic KYC** - Existing users with verified emails get basic verification automatically

### 2. ❌ "Unable to add other payment methods" Error

**Problem**: The withdrawal methods system was trying to access database tables that didn't exist and had validation issues for different rail types.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Created Withdrawal Methods Table** - Complete table with all rail-specific columns
- ✅ **Added Fee Structure System** - Proper fee calculation for all payment rails
- ✅ **Built Payment Method Dialog** - User-friendly interface to add methods
- ✅ **Added Rail-specific Validation** - Proper validation for Stripe, PayPal, Wise, etc.
